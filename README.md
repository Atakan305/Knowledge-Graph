# Knowledge-Graph
Creating a knowledge graph from any Github repository.

A multidisciplinary working system was followed in the process of creating the Knowledge Graph. According to this, the project aims to create knowledge graphs by pulling data from a specific GitHub repository using GitHub REST API v3 and Matplotlib libraries. The Knowledge Graph creation project includes the following main steps:
-	Pulling data from repository using Github REST API v3
-	Processing and analyzing fetched data
-	Visualization using Matplotlib library
-	Reporting the emerging knowledge graph

Main Steps
1.	Getting GitHub Repository Information: At project startup, the GitHub API is used to pull basic information from the user-specified GitHub repository:
- Files
- Folders
- Services
- Backbone
2.	Data Analysis and Processing: The captured data is analyzed and processed in Python. In particular, certain data may need to be selected and processed.
3.	Creating a Knowledge Graph with Matplotlib: The processed data was represented as a graph using Matplotlib.
4.	Commissioning of Access Tools: In order to run the main functions mentioned above, this last step aims to enter personal access tokens and other information and ensure successful data flow.
